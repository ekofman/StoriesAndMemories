Rosita
0:00:00
We arrived in Santiago, my mother, my brother and I, in January of 1939.

Eric
0:00:09
Right after the earthquake?

Rosita
0:00:11
After the earthquake. And with that, the ship arrived, where my mother's two sisters were coming from. and the uncle, this is Favel Haichelis with his family 

Eric
Ah, by coincidence they arrived at the same time? 

Rosita
No, they made an agreement, I guess, there in Europe, somehow, and they all arrived in the same boat. The family was much smaller and much more united. Social life was more like a life... The meetings were for the family. The family would meet all the time for birthdays, anniversaries, etc. So we saw each other a lot. Also, we were all poorer. There were no cars. No, it's true. So we didn't travel. We didn't travel. We were all in Santiago. It was a very different environment.

Eric
0:01:35
Yes.

Rosita
0:01:37
I don't know if you can imagine that we all lived 6 or 8 blocks away. All in the same neighborhood. We could walk or take the tram. In that time, in 1939, I'm going to tell you, no family had a car. Yes, sure. Do you understand?


Eric
0:02:07
I wanted to, if it doesn't bother you too much to talk about that, because it was surely a traumatic moment. How was that transfer from Concepción to Santiago? Do you remember those days after the earthquake? Or were you too young?

Rosita
0:02:35
Look, no, no, no. A cousin, son of Bine's. Bine was married to a man of surname Motlis. Bine is Ingrid's grandmother.

Eric
0:02:50
and mother of Jaime Motlis

Rosita
0:02:55
and mother of?

Rosita
0:02:57
Jaime Motlis

Rosita
0:02:59
Jaime Motlis who was already a doctor to the government, let's say, for the earthquake. 


Eric
0:03:17
Did they all go down to Concepción?

Rosita
0:03:22
Of course. And he traveled to Concepción and somehow helped my mom to the transfer. The train seems to have continued to work. Because in those times, in those times, the transport along Chile was done by train. There was a train that went from Santiago to Puerto Montt. Now, it took a long time. Because the paved roads had very few kilometers and there were very few cars.

Rosita
0:04:06
So, the transport to the south was basically by train. There was a time for transport to the north also by train. But that disappeared a few years later. We traveled by train to Santiago. And the first 3 or 4 years, we lived together in two very big houses. First in one, then in the other, with the Haichelis family, who came from Europe, and with my mom's brother.

Eric
A lot of people! And did you in general get along well or did you start to drive each other crazy?

Rosita
0:04:59
They were five, right, then with my two aunts seven and us three made 10. 
But the houses were big. So, as I was saying, we lived in the same house for economic reasons, for about two or three years. So, that was another reason for the family to get together.
... Everyone came to see the newcomers, the grines, as we called them here.

Eric
What does grine mean? Like green?

Rosita
0:05:45
Green, but it means gringos. The grines were the gringos.

Eric
Because they were fresh off the boat, as they say.

Rosita
0:05:57
So, well, as I was saying, I remember it because I saw them for many years. For example, we lived until... wait let me think. Yes, when I got married, I lived on Alameda, the street was called Alameda. And aunt Tzippe's textile factory was two blocks from where I lived, while aunt Bine lived about eight blocks away. Anyway, of those houses that I visited the most, I remember quite a lot.

Rosita
0:06:46
Aunt Feige, who I tell you that I almost don't remember, also lived near there. So, those were people I saw during many years, until I got married. I saw them very often. 

Rosita
0:07:05
I arrived in Santiago when I was 9 years old, and I got married when I was 20, 21. So all those years, those 10 years, 11 years,

Eric
0:07:18
You lived in that world with those people.

Rosita
0:07:20
Yes, I lived a lot with these people, that's why I remember them a lot. 

Eric
And do you remember a lot of how it was, do you remember the earthquake, 

Rosita
0:07:45
We were away for summer holidays. January, you know that in the month of holidays in Santiago it's summer, January and February. The earthquake was on January 24th. And I don't remember, we were at a beach resort that is near Concepción, because we lived in Concepción. The resort is called Penco, with a P for Pedro.

Rosita
0:08:04
Penco?

Rosita
0:08:06
Penco. That's what it's called. The town had a really good beach. I don't know, I haven't returned. And I don't remember the earthquake itself, but I remember sleeping in tents in a park.

Eric
0:08:21
Ah, wow.

Rosita
0:08:23
I remember that. I don't know if I really remember that or if they told me. I remember seeing a ditch, a crack, a hole in the ground. I don't know if it's true that I remember that or if I made it up.

Eric
0:08:37
In Pucon, there is a boat that got stuck in the river, that had entered from the sea by a tsunami. Was that the same earthquake? I'm not sure. 

Rosita
It sounds familiar, but I'm not sure.

Eric
0:09:01
But it seems that there was another big one in the 60s, so it could have been that. 

Rosita
That earthquake is called here in Chile, the Chillan earthquake.

Eric
0:09:02
The one in 39?

Rosita
0:09:03
The Chillan earthquake, because that was the epicenter That was where there was the most destruction.
There was also in other places, in Concepción. But Chillan was the most damaged, the most damaged city Now, in Chile, at that time, there was a lot of construction made of adobe. And the adobe would collapse. So, as I told you, we were there for a few days. I can't tell you how many, I don't remember. I have the very vague idea that they were bringing us food. I don't remember much of that. And then, this Santiago transfer came.

Rosita
0:10:08
Our first house in Santiago was on the street called Agustinas. I remember that house and sometimes I pass by it because it is still standing.

Eric
0:10:18
Oh, really? It's still standing? Wow.

Rosita
0:10:21
Yes, it's still standing.

Eric
0:10:24
And now it's in a more poor neighborhood or has the neighborhood stayed similar?

Rosita
0:10:30
No, no, but it is a neighborhood... Let's see, here they say that Santiago starts in Plaza Italia. Do you know which is Plaza Italia?

Eric
0:10:46
Plaza Italia, yes, in the center there. 

Rosita
And South of that is a different Santiago, it's a working-class neighborhood. We lived there until...
I lived there until... Not there, I lived there until I got married, in a good apartment building. But, I mean, we all moved from Plaza Italia to the top as soon as we could.

Eric
0:11:36
Yes, it was where to start.

Rosita
0:11:30
Sure, for example, at that time much of the Jewish colonia lived near the principal synagogue., which was on Serrano street. That street Serrano is in the very center of Santiago. I don't know if you remember any of the streets in the center, Ahumada, and the streets of the neighborhood. I don't know if you remember the streets in the center, Ahumada, Plaza de Armas. Well, that's the center of Santiago, and this synagogue was also sold and installed instead in La Dehesa.

Eric
0:12:32
In what sense installed?

Rosita
0:12:37
Of course, they sold the land, which was large, which is a commercial land. They probably got a big price for it. I don't know, because they probably could have built a building with a lot of floors. And they have the headquarters now in La Dehesa, In a very beautiful community center called Merkaz.

Eric
0:13:03
I went with you to a Rosh Hashanah ceremony once, right?

Rosita
0:13:08
Maybe, maybe, yes

Rosita
0:13:13
Yes I wanted to tell you By chance I wanted to tell you Besides personally finding this story very interesting, I find especially interesting the story of your mom, of Esther 

Rosita
0:13:33
But of course

Eric
She had an incredibly dramatic life 

Rosita
0:13:38
It's incredible, of course She became a widow before she turned 30

Eric
0:13:44
Yes, wow, very young

Rosita
0:13:46
And with two children and two single siblings to take care of.

Eric
It's really incredible what she did -- and also, how old was she? She arrived in Chile at around 20.

Rosita
0:14:01
She came to Chile in 1928 and was born in 1909.

Eric
So she came at 19 years old.

Rosita
19.

Eric
Yes, and well, let me know if you get tired, but I have a few questions if you don't mind. I wanted to know a little more about this.

Rosita
0:14:20
No, not at all. Look, my mother got through life, in reality, with a lot of effort and zero preparation, you know? Well, she left with my dad, initially with help from my uncle Aaron, first to Puerto Montt. When they just had gotten married, and that's why I was born there. But they had arrived first --

Eric
When they arrived When she arrived in Chile. She had met Jose Greiber on that boat.

Rosita
Yes, on the boat.

Eric
0:15:06
It's an amazing story. And they arrived in Santiago, but when they arrived in Santiago --

Rosita
0:15:12
I don't have any details on that. I don't know when they got married either. But they must have gotten married a long time after, because I was born on March 30, 1930. So they must have gotten married a year before. In 1929, right? 

Eric
Because that's how things worked back then

Rosita
0:15:38
Of course, of course Before it was like that, so you can calculate those dates. But what, look, my mom worked with my dad in the factory from the beginning since they started it. A textile factory I told you that, right?

Eric
0:15:56
Oh, I didn't know you had founded it together with your father

Rosita
0:16:04
Yes, of course, we both worked in the factory, I remember a little bit of Concepción, I was almost 8 years old and I remember that factory. At first we lived inside, in a room in the back of the factory and then we moved to a very nice house in front on the other side of the street but practically we circulated freely between the house and the factory

Eric
0:16:44
They were almost connected, yes.

Rosita
0:16:48
Directly facing each other, and this factory was a factory of knitted goods, of sweaters, vests, well, that were knitted with some machines, I don't know if you've ever seen them, maybe never, some hand machines, they weren't electric machines, some hand machines, which, well, anyway. Well, anyway...

Rosita
0:17:16
They operate with a pedal, right? Do they have a pedal?

Rosita
0:17:15
No no, the operator was on her feet. And there were some feeders that spooled the wool in, and the operator moved the car from right to left by hand, the car moved... 

Eric
Did they let you help in the factory or did they want you to study? 


Rosita
0:17:25
Of course, I learned to sew, I remember that I learned to sew on that machine. Well, at that time, it was what we had. My mother had a small workshop, but there were bigger factories, finer fabrics, and they all worked with the same type of machine.

Rosita
0:17:47
But what I want to tell you is that my mother, once she became widowed and came to Santiago, managed to set up a new fabric factory. In Alameda, in front of where we lived, we went to live there once the sisters got married, their situation improved, and we went to live there because the factory was in front.

Eric
Yes.

Rosita
0:18:42
Okay? Now I'm talking about the year during the war, or a little bit after the war ended, 1945, 1946. I don't know how many years it would be. But look, when I remember, for example, when I was about 16 years old, that is, in 1946, my mother was already very preoccupied with making sure I was well-dressed. She always liked clothes and I did too, and I remember that she would take me to places that weren't cheap. So she was in a more stable situation. And during all those years, until the year 70.

Eric
0:19:30
In Chile, a question about that you said that when you were 16 in Chile there was a tradition of I don't know if a Jewish or Chilean tradition but at 16 you had a debutante party or something like that?

Rosita
0:20:00
No, we didn't have a party I mean, the girls of the Chilean aristocracy maybe, but not among the Jews. No, there wasn't. But what I want to tell you is that I'm talking about the year 1940, well, she arrived in Santiago in '39. Let's say, the first years were hard, I imagine, and until the year 70, so we're talking about 45 to 70, about 25 years, 24 years. My mom got very rich. When I say very rich,  I'm not talking about millions of dollars, 

0:20:42
but my mother had many properties, she had a building that's still standing, I'm going to tell you in what neighborhood because it'll just confuse you. But when Allende was elected, there was a panic. And the dollar went to the clouds. And people started selling their properties for very few dollars. And that's what happened to my mom.

Eric
0:21:20
So she sold it for very few dollars and after Allende he had no value.

Rosita
0:21:29
She sold it for very few dollars and there was a single property that for documentation reasons she wasn't able to sell, and that was what allowed her to live self-sufficiently. Because my mom, around the year '45, she remarried, she married a man by the name of Poniatchik.

Eric
0:22:16
Poniatchik?

Rosita
0:22:18
Yes. What was his name? I forgot his name. Well, this man was a Polish man.

Eric
0:22:32
Oh yes, I have a picture of him.

Rosita
0:22:36
Maybe, it could be in my marriage photo. This man was divorced. and she had a son who died not long ago his name was Raul a little bit younger than Nano

Rosita
0:23:00
but this Poniatchik, was his name? well, it doesn't matter he also had a fabric factory and he she got married to my mom or started dating my mom, he installed hits fabric factory in Alameda, in front of my mom's.

Rosita
0:23:25
And, apparently, apparently, I'm telling you this because my mom was the most discreet woman in the world. I never heard her argue or fight with her husband. When did she do it? I don't know. The fact is that she decided and sold her factory to help him.

Eric
0:23:46
To help him in his factory.

Rosita
0:23:49
Yes, yes. And she was helping him with whatever it was. But the marriage, after a few years, ended.

Eric
0:23:58
And did you like him or did you find him disagreeable?

Rosita
0:24:05
No, no, he didn't have any... Let's see... I didn't dislike it, but I didn't like it either. Neutral. Yes. Something I'm going to tell you a little bit about my mom's story. My mom then sold her factory and closed her factory, I don't know. After she separated or divorced, after a year or two, I don't know how long, she tried to start a workshop again. And she couldn't do it. Ah, she couldn't get it up.
No, she invested a lot of money, I don't know how much.

Rosita
0:25:05
I don't know, and she didn't succeed, she failed, I don't know. But as I told you, if it hadn't been because she sold all those properties. When I say all, it's a building that has, it's there, and in very good conditions, that has about 6 or 8 floors and must have about 20 or 30 apartments, and 3 or 4 good apartments, in good location in the rest of Santiago. And she had bought them as investments, she had a good way of investing. Of course, because in those years, of course, she wasn't going to buy bonds, so apart from buying dollars, which was what everyone did, always did in Chile. They were called "Lockshins," no?

Rosita
0:26:00
You know? Lockshins? Lockshins, which are a kind of noodle. I don't know why they call it that, but the word Lokshin is a Yiddish word. Basically, it was a way of not talking about dollars openly. 

Eric
So one would say that it had a lot of Lokshin.

Rosita
0:26:07
Of course, exactly. Just like that. Other than dollars, the other investment was properties. That's what people invested their money in. 

0:26:34
As I told you, I'm talking to you, I don't know, I can't calculate it. But it was enough for her to be able to live just comfortably enough until the end. And the truth is that until the end, when she died, she had very little money left. Very little money.

Eric
0:26:54
So it lasted just enough?

Rosita
0:26:58
It lasted just right, of course. But what I'm getting at is that she was able to start this business on her own, because neither my brother nor I worked there. After all of these catastrophes.

Eric
0:27:17
Yes, incredible, really a force, because I imagine that she hadn't studied much.

Rosita
0:27:25
No, nothing, imagine, she wrote and spoke Russian

Eric
0:27:27
And was it hard for her to learn Spanish or at the end of her life did she speak Spanish well?

Rosita
0:27:31
No, Spanish she spoke always pretty badly, with a foreign accent and with a lot of mistakes But she wrote it.

Eric
0:27:48
But she spoke Russian more than Yiddish?

Rosita
0:27:52
No, no, she spoke Yiddish. And I still understand Yiddish I mean, anyone who speaks Yiddish to me, I understand everything

Eric
0:28:02
Yes, I remember we were discussing that book I was reading in German when we went to the south And you understood German perfectly

Rosita
0:28:12
German no, but Yiddish has a lot of German words So there are many things that I do understand I understand a lot of things. So, well, that, let's say, that's a story I wanted to mention to you.

Rosita
0:28:37
And well, the other one that had a strong entrepreneurial spirit is Mina. Mina, here in Santiago, set up a clothing business that went very well for her.

Eric
0:28:50
Oh yeah? A business like a store?

Rosita
0:28:53
A store, a store where they sold women's clothing. And where she was the main driver and Uli was just handling the bills. Uli was not a businessman. 

Eric
0:29:06
Was that her husband?

Rosita
0:29:11
Her husband, her husband was Uli Chazanas.

Rosita
0:29:14
The father of Goyo, of course. The father of Goyo was a Lithuanian. Quite a gentleman, quite educated, apparently, but the one who was the real engine was Mina.

Eric
0:29:34
Ah, good I would have loved to interview her, but it seems like she passed away 3 or 4 years ago.

Rosita
0:29:43
Yes, well, she can tell you about that part of the family. I think she will make you happy. 

Eric
So, did she design her own clothes?

Rosita
0:29:52
I don't think she designed them.

Rosita
0:29:54
I don't know how it was, but I imagine there were small workshops where they had the clothes made and sold them in the center. Because they were in the center. And well, surely the percentage of profit was high, and with the money from that store they went to the United States and they went to the United States because Uli already had a sister who lived there who also lived in Chile, I met her

Rosita
0:30:37
so she already had a connection

Rosita
0:30:39
of course, but as I told you, the money

Rosita
0:30:42
to start buying properties she left that business of clothing from Chile and well, I understand that she was already married and Esther was the older sister

Rosita
0:31:00
so I imagine that she started she set up this factory and then with that income she helped her sisters too, who were minors, right? look, the two got married very quickly.

Rosita
0:31:16
The girl and the boy. And the boy's husband also had a business of women's clothing, women's clothing, and he was doing very well. So there, he didn't need my mom's help anymore.

Rosita
0:31:30
And the girl went to the United States because of Ayenda's election?

Eric
0:31:36
Yes, of course.

Rosita
0:31:40
And then, did the Brana go to Israel?

Rosita
0:31:43
No, no, no. I don't know if the Brana went to Israel before or also more or less at that time, because wait, Lali...

Rosita
0:31:54
Oh no, Lali grew up in Chile.

Rosita
0:31:57
I mean, when she left, when she left, let's see, Labrana was married to Simon Bergstein. And the whole family went to Israel because Simon didn't want his daughters to marry Goyne. No, it's true.

Eric
0:32:17
Totally true.

Rosita
0:32:19
They went to school here at the Hebrew Institute. Wait, Labrán and Lamina, you said they got married in 1940-1941. No, it must have been before Allende. I don't know when. I don't know when. You can ask Lali. But Lamina, I think she left at the time of the tooth

Rosita
0:32:52
And how did she react? Do you remember?

Rosita
0:32:54
Because look, when the girl left, Alex was still in the architecture school I don't remember

Rosita
0:33:05
Ollo's brother

Rosita
0:33:07
Yes, I think he must have been 3 or 4 years younger, I don't remember Marita knows that because she seems to have met Goyo at school or something. Marita may know a little more about the date. But I think it was around there, I'm not sure.

Rosita
0:33:30
Esther left Russia after the Bolsheviks took power and then Lenin and she once commented on a parallel between Allende and that Do you remember how she reacted before the Allende election? Allende with what? That she had left Russia just when the Bolsheviks arrived?

Rosita
0:34:02
It was... My mother in the 28th Oh, she had already taken

Rosita
0:34:10
Stalin's power Yes

Rosita
0:34:14
Of course, but I don't remember I don't remember I don't remember Do you think she came from She came from Bessarabia which at that time was a Russian province

Rosita
0:34:26
that's why she spoke Russian. But no, I don't remember hearing any comment.

Rosita
0:34:35
And why did she have more fear of Allende's economic policies?

Rosita
0:34:40
She said she wanted to nationalize, that evidently a widow, a widow without a charge, because my brother and I were already adults and independent professionals, and that I was 15 years old, a little less. In the street, in the neighborhood called Añoñoa, there was a good house, a two-story house, and I was very happy to have a house.

Rosita
0:35:56
I was very happy to have a house. I was very happy to have a house. I was very happy to have a house. the I can't tell you how many times I lived in front of the house where Joselyn now lives. There is a condominium.

Rosita
0:36:49
There is a condominium where they must have made, I don't know, about 5 or 8 houses. Because it was a condominium of 5,000 meters Those condominiums were sold for $5,000

Rosita
0:37:19
Do you realize? Yes, compared to a house

Rosita
0:37:23
Because the dollar was not the dollar of today But it was the only security As it has been for a long time

Rosita
0:37:38
and we'll see if that continues with what's happening now

Rosita
0:37:45
look, of course, at this moment there's another kind of problem the pandemic, the global pandemic the dollar has gone up a lot in Chile and now it's

Eric
0:38:00
hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

Rosita
0:38:15
It seems like the connection got lost there. You say that the dollar is very high in Chile now?

Rosita
0:38:22
Yes, it is. Very high. I don't know how it was when you came, but for a long time it was around 700, between 650 and 700 for several years

Rosita
0:38:38
And now it's at how much?

Rosita
0:38:40
And now it's above 850

Rosita
0:38:45
Yes, that's very high, I don't think I've ever seen it so high

Rosita
0:38:50
No, it has never been of that value Because Chile had a relatively solid economy With a lot of exports With a good copper price Which went down because China buys less, right?

Rosita
0:39:05
Yes, that's true

Rosita
0:39:07
So, well And also, well, we had I hope it doesn't happen again. Before the COVID-19, we had those 3 months of violence that started on October 18.

14
0:39:26
Yes.

Rosita
0:39:27
And now it's over because there are military stops on the streets to make the pandemic stop

9
0:39:41
yes

Rosita
0:39:43
well, but yes, you can read that economic part in the economist

Rosita
0:39:49
yes, sure yes, like that did he ever tell you, well, yes because the Aster was already in Russia when Stalin was totally in power in Russia. Did he ever tell you if he encountered anti-Semitism in Russia?

Rosita
0:40:08
No, we never talked about those things. I don't remember talking about anti-Semitism with my mother.

6
0:40:16
No, no.

Rosita
0:40:18
I'm sure life was a little better in Chile, which is what they offered him in the Russians.

Rosita
0:40:24
No, anyway, because, look, they came from a small town, where, the truth is I don't know what my grandfather worked, I don't know, but it seems they had land, and the work on the land has never been easy.

Rosita
0:40:41
You mean Ruben Buchmann?

Rosita
0:40:43
Of course.

Rosita
0:40:44
that I had sent them but another interesting thing that I found that I am now trying to find out and find other records but there is very little but I found a voting record like the voter registration of Ruben and his brother Moshe. I didn't know she had a brother. I never knew she had a brother.

Rosita
0:41:09
The truth is that my mom, no, my mom told me very little about her father. But I think you told me, the last time we talked about this, you told me about Ruben's brother,

Rosita
0:41:25
and how there was a story, at least, I don't know if it's true, but there was a story

Rosita
0:41:39
No, it wasn't Ruben's brother, it was my mom's brother

Rosita
0:41:43
Oh, that he had fought in the Crimean War? No, no, no, I don't know that

Rosita
0:41:48
No, my mom's brother, no, because he was the same age as her, a little younger No, no, in the Crimean War, that must have happened elsewhere No Yes, so...

Rosita
0:42:00
No, I don't think that's correct because that would have been too early, but... When was the Crimean War? Like in 1850, so a little before this would have happened. But it's interesting because I think that this must be... I think that it has to be your grandfather who appears He says he was registered in Orgeyev

Rosita
0:42:32
Orgey And I think you told me that the city is called Orgey or Orgeyev or something like that in Moldova No, no, no Orgey That's what the storyteller told me Ah, maybe, you know, I think Lali told me about it, I just remembered

Rosita
0:42:53
No, because I didn't

Rosita
0:42:56
So I found a record from 1906 by Ruben Buchmann But strangely I can't find any wedding records Between him and Esther's mother But I'm sure there must be something

Rosita
0:43:14
Of course, because that marriage has to be Clara Heitlis with Ruben Gutmann

13
0:43:21
Yes, something like that

Rosita
0:43:22
And calculating by the years, by the age

Rosita
0:43:25
it has to be around 1890

Rosita
0:43:29
I was born in 1890. My mother was born in 1909, but she had an older sister.

Rosita
0:43:38
Yes, around 1900, a little before, a little after.

Rosita
0:43:42
Do you remember any aspect of your life in Russia? Do you know any details of how life was there?

Eric
0:43:49
No.

Rosita
0:43:50
Look, my mom worked at the same time as my dad.

Rosita
0:43:58
Before I was... Before I was... Before I was... Before I was born,

Rosita
0:44:08
I must have been very little. And the time after that, I must have been very little. And the time after that, I must have been very little. And then I went to school,

Rosita
0:44:20
she went to work, and she never told me stories about Africa. And he never told me stories about Europe, never Ah, yes, that makes sense Ah, but I had forgotten that Esther came with her brother, Gregorio

Rosita
0:44:43
Of course So there is a whole family on Gregorio's side in Chile still

Rosita
0:44:51
Chile He was not able to maintain the home and the children of that marriage were adopted.

Rosita
0:45:13
Ah, really? They were adopted. Ah, wow.

Rosita
0:45:18
The oldest would be called Ruben Bunkman.

Rosita
0:45:26
Oh, and did they have another brother named Ruben? No, I'm talking about Gregorio's sons. Oh, so he named a son after his father. I'm not sure about that one, but there was another one, smaller, that I know was adopted by a Jewish family. Interesting. The other thing that really fascinates me is that I can't find anything about the Graeber family in Brazil. There are several Graebers, right?

Rosita
0:46:00
Oh yeah, there are a few, but I can't find any.

Rosita
0:46:05
Because your dad met a guy called Fernando.

Rosita
0:46:10
So maybe I should ask him to contact me.

Rosita
0:46:14
But what surprised me is that I couldn't find any trace of your dad.

Rosita
0:46:19
Like in immigration records, or emigration, or ship records. No, nothing.

Rosita
0:46:25
And what do you find?

Rosita
0:47:16
I don't know.

Rosita
0:47:18
No, the truth is that it doesn't appear. And in Ancestry.com there aren't many records of South America compared to the United States. Because there's another graver

Rosita
0:47:28
that came to Chile and I was at his house in San Pablo. Let's see, what's his name?

10
0:47:36
I don't know.

Rosita
0:47:37
I don't know. I don't know. I'll send you the link. But the father of my brothers, there was another one called Moises. Ah, yes, I have it written here. Joaquin, Moises, Salomon, and Esther.

Rosita
0:48:21
Joaquin, Moises, and the other one?

Rosita
0:48:25
Salomon, Salomon, something like that. I don't know if it was my dad's mom, Clara, or the one who married Ruben.

Rosita
0:48:50
I think you told me her name was Clara Chocler

Rosita
0:48:53
Clara, but I'm not sure if my mom's mom was Clara But Lali can know that because of her mom

4
0:49:02
Oh, good I'm not sure if both were Clara

Rosita
0:49:07
So you haven't found anything in Brazil about the Gravers?

Rosita
0:49:17
Yes, I was surprised, and not about the Choclers either. I was really surprised not to find any trace of the Gravers or the Choclers in all these data phases.

Rosita
0:49:28
I've tried it, it's curious. And look, I know that one of the brothers, Solomon, I'm not sure if it was Solomon, it was Joaquin I think. Joaquin lived in Manaus.

Rosita
0:49:43
Ah, okay. In Brazil.

Rosita
0:49:47
He lived in a couch.

Eric
0:49:49
Manaus?

Rosita
0:49:51
Manaus. Is it a city in Brazil?

Rosita
0:49:55
It's a city in Brazil that was once very important. It even has an opera house

Rosita
0:50:04
Rosita, this is super cool I don't know if... I think I sent you an email a few years ago I found a record of a Joaquin Graber who won a chess championship in Manaos Ah, that's possible. Yes, so that's entertaining. We have a chess champion in the family. Yes.

Rosita
0:50:34
And you know, when you told me, or when Lali told me the story, and I think you had also been described by your father as a Brazilian, but was he born in Brazil or in Europe?

Rosita
0:50:50
No, no, no. In Odessa. I know he was born in Odessa.

Rosita
0:50:54
Ah, okay.

Eric
0:50:56
And he had spent a few years in Brazil and for some... Do you know why he embarked on a ship to Chile?

Rosita
0:51:01
Look, the truth is I don't know how it happened. Hmm. Interesting. But in some way your parents met on a boat between Sao Paulo and Concepcion or something like that? No, between Sao Paulo and Valparaiso it would be.

Eric
0:51:20
Ah, ok.

Rosita
0:51:21
Of course they are on the other side of the ocean. Yes, well it's a long time to get to know each other, right?

Eric
0:51:41
Yes

Rosita
0:51:42
In that time, two months would be enough, no, it would be like a month, I imagine, or half a month, enough for a relationship You sent me a photo of her posing With a hat I remember

Rosita
0:52:08
Yeah, something like that

Rosita
0:52:10
I think I have something like that Oh, I don't know if she told you, but I have... Because of my correspondence with Ingrid You told me? Where is she now? The truth is that I haven't talked to her in 4 years, but maybe I'll send her an email because she told me that she was very frustrated not being able to find traces of the Highclers

Rosita
0:52:38
but now that I found this record of Nellie's Island I think I would find her interesting Of course, tell her

Rosita
0:52:44
But she sent me I remember the Ingrid, I won't say much, but among all the aunts, the one we were closest to was Aunt Vines, who is the grandmother of Ingrid. Who was the grandmother of Ingrid?

Eric
0:53:07
Aunt Vines.

Rosita
0:53:08
Oh yeah, yeah. I don't know if I sent you the messages, but Ingrid told me when I was talking to her that she was not in love, but fascinated with the dwarf. That he had incredible eyes. Oh yeah? Yeah. Because she lived in Concepción with you

Rosita
0:53:39
She, she, let's see, where was I? I don't remember where Ingrid lived, I don't remember

Rosita
0:53:44
Oh no, sorry, here it says that Pablo Gottlieb lived in Puerto Montt and that he met Esther when he was in the university in Concepción Let's see, Ingrid's father is Pablo Gottlieb

Rosita
0:53:58
I think Ingrid told me that. Maybe. Maybe the neighborhood must have been very small in Puerto Montt. And well, there you can see, there you can see, there you can have met. But there Pablo was still single. I think, I think.

Rosita
0:54:15
Yes, and the Ingrid told me that. I don't know if she told you that. I don't know if she told you that. I don't know if she told you that. Pablo is still single, I think

Rosita
0:54:29
Yes, and Ingrid said that she thinks that maybe Estelle introduced Pablo to Clara

Rosita
0:54:41
Maybe, maybe, of course Because Clara was very short

Rosita
0:54:52
Oh yeah?

Rosita
0:54:54
Quite short, but she was a prepared, cult woman I don't know if she studied or something, I don't remember Well, because her brother, as I said, was a doctor Clara's brother?

Eric
0:55:11
That's Jaime Mota

Rosita
0:55:13
The brother of Clara? That is Jaime Moté Yes, Jaime. Jaime was a man of the Renaissance He wrote that book, right? He wrote a book about the Jewish colony?

Rosita
0:55:29
He had two university children. He thinks that for that generation, it wasn't so common to go to university. A calendar that served forever, an eternal calendar Like a mechanical clock that calculated the months? I don't know if he received it. Those were the two who studied at the university and also Jaime Motley, who studied medicine

Rosita
0:56:07
and was a doctor all his life.

Rosita
0:56:10
And he was a doctor, and he was a doctor, and he was a doctor. And he was a doctor.

Rosita
0:56:18
And he was a doctor. And he was a doctor his whole life. And there were no more students or professionals of the generation of the children of all those who arrived in Chile after coming from the United States.

Rosita
0:57:11
One thing Ingrid told me was that she vividly remembered the afternoons spent in the uncle Abraham's house For her it was a very strong memory to have spent a lot of time with uncle Abraham Do you remember that too? There's no big house

Rosita
0:57:39
I mean the Laron

Rosita
0:57:41
Yes, I remember

Rosita
0:57:43
They had a big house in a corner I don't remember where it was but it was somewhere where the north-south road is somewhere in the center

Rosita
0:57:57
It was a big corner house where they had a fabric factory. That's where my mother came to make fabrics. They lived there, and it was a house that had a large courtyard with central floors. to the street where the fabrics were sold. Yes, the youngest of the daughters, I just told you about her, had a lot of books.

Rosita
0:59:04
And I helped her read books. Because this was a block of my house.

Rosita
0:59:10
Ah, good. So she had a collection of books, like, what kind of books?

Rosita
0:59:16
Ah, no, they were not, they were police books that I must have read when I was 9, 10, 11 years old. But there was any amount and I would go there all the time to look for it. de los pocos recuerdos de esa época. Pero de la casa de la Ingrid, de la, de la, de la, de Pablo, con la Clarita. Clarita se llamaba la mamá de la, de la Ingrid, Clara Clarita. Así que a lo mejor, a lo mejor así se llamaba la, no, no, no, no creo, no.

Rosita
0:59:58
I don't remember the house of the cleric. I can describe the house of the dine, but I remember the house of the cleric. I was hurt once, but I don't remember.

Rosita
1:00:19
I would love to write a book or a document about this immigration story to South America. Nobody talks about it, at least not in the US. You read a lot of books and descriptions of immigrants to the US, but nobody talks about the ones who came to South America so I find it very interesting

Rosita
1:00:53
Look, of those who arrived in Argentina there is more history because many arrived You know that in Argentina there is a town called Moisesville

Rosita
1:01:05
Oh I didn't know

Rosita
1:01:07
He helped bring a large group of Argentine Jews to this town called Moisesville. Interesting, I should read more about that.

Rosita
1:01:23
It's a movie about the desert between the rivers

Rosita
1:01:29
It's about the Jewish Gauchos The Jewish Gauchos? Yes Interesting, I didn't know anything about that But it makes sense, there should be some cities like that

Rosita
1:01:48
That were imported from Europe

Rosita
1:02:04
Look, at one point it was said that there were 600,000 Jews in Argentina

Rosita
1:02:10
And eventually many went to Israel for sure

Rosita
1:02:14
Yes, but against the 15,000 that have always been calculated in Chile

Eric
1:02:20
Wow

Rosita
1:02:21
Do you see the difference?

Rosita
1:02:22
Yes, incredible And what was the house like?

Rosita
1:02:28
Look, from what I remember, let's say, once you entered, you entered a corridor, a corridor that was outdoors and that had a garden, a garden attached to the corridor and there was the wall that separated it from the other house and to this corridor they gave all the rooms that is, to go from one room to another, as far as I remember, you had to go out to the corridor

Rosita
1:03:05
almost like a hotel

Rosita
1:03:07
and I remember, I don't remember anything else.

Rosita
1:03:18
It's amazing the details that stick together. For example, the only thing I remember from your house in Luis Pasteur are the tangerines.

5
1:03:25
The?

Rosita
1:03:27
The tangerines, the oranges.

Rosita
1:03:29
Ah, the tangerines, yes, they were delicious.

Rosita
1:03:34
and also very rich

Rosita
1:03:36
I think you could write and fill in what is missing with your imagination

Rosita
1:03:46
Yes, I'm sure that reading some stories you can do that but I love having these small details because I'm sure I'm going to forget a lot of things if I don't write them down so yes, the book is very interesting. So, the truth is that they lived very well.

Rosita
1:04:07
If you want to write something else down, the fabric factory of the Chipe, or Cecilia, I say her because she was the one who worked, was on Cueto Street.

Rosita
1:04:21
Oh yeah, of the Chipe. And it was called New York Jersey, I have it written here.

Rosita
1:04:28
Yes, but it's a city, that's the easy one.

Rosita
1:04:31
In the street, Cueto.

Rosita
1:04:33
Cueto, there's another name I have on the tip of my tongue, it's a parallel. But if I remember, I'll give it to you. And the aunt lives in Garcia Reyes Street.

Rosita
1:04:46
Garcia Reyes, incredible how you remember all this. So the truth is that after a few years of having set up these factories, all the families lived relatively well. Everyone had a big house, everyone had factories. in the factory? Yes, of course, everyone lived quite well. Let's see, the ugly one, no.

Rosita
1:05:14
Except for the ugly one. That was frankly, it seems that the sisters helped her. Yes, and Paulina, who had two children, Miguel, she married Mr. Kuzner. She went to live with her daughter, Olga.

Rosita
1:05:50
Did Paulina end up living with Olga?

Rosita
1:05:53
With Olga Dubinowski. Olga had a very nice house. Olga had no children, she adopted a little girl.

Rosita
1:06:05
And did Olga ever get married?

Eric
1:06:07
What?

Rosita
1:06:08
Did she get married or did she adopt the girl and raise her herself? Wait, Olga married Angel Dubinocki.

Rosita
1:06:14
Ah, but she didn't have any children of her own.

Rosita
1:06:17
She didn't have any children of her own.

Rosita
1:06:19
And she... I don't remember what street she lived in, but she had a very nice house, she had a very good taste, she dressed very well, she was an elegant housewife, she received very well, she cooked very well.

Rosita
1:06:41
So, a, how do you say, a maximum hostess.

Rosita
1:06:48
Yes, an aficionado. And like I said, she adopted this little girl, to whom she named her mother, Paulina. She named her mother. But I can't tell you the story of Paulina.

Eric
1:07:02
I don't know it. Of the adopted daughter.

Rosita
1:07:04
Of the adopted daughter, yes. I don't know the story. I don't know the story. Maybe Ruby could know more.

Rosita
1:07:18
That's interesting because in general, in the Jewish tradition, it's not very accepted to give the name of someone who is still alive, right?

Rosita
1:07:28
Sure, but I'm thinking about if she adopted him after his mother died.

Rosita
1:07:34
Oh, it could be.

Rosita
1:07:36
Yes, I'm not sure. I got into doubt when I was telling you. And... well, anyway, there are many descendants because they are... well, there are many trunks. cousin let's see the the brother

Rosita
1:08:03
the youngest son of Cecilia Fasset do you follow me? the youngest son of Cecilia Fasset? Gregorio

Eric
1:08:13
was the son of Cecilia

Rosita
1:08:15
the youngest son

Rosita
1:08:17

Rosita
1:08:30
He had a son His name was What's his name? Ismael

Rosita
1:08:38
Ah, good

Rosita
1:08:40
Yes, Ismael Fassler married Veronica Link No, not Veronica Veronica is the daughter. Wait. With the... Yes, also with Veronica Link.

Rosita
1:08:56
So Veronica Link was Cecilia's granddaughter.

Rosita
1:09:02
No. Ismael was Cecilia's grandson.

Rosita
1:09:06
Ah, the vice-granddaughter.

Rosita
1:09:09
And Veronica is Aaron's granddaughter.

Rosita
1:09:13
Ah. Aaron's?

Rosita
1:09:17
A granddaughter of Aaron

Rosita
1:09:19
of Aaron? of Aaron oh you mean they got married and were like cousins second degree Veronica Link was

Eric
1:09:33
oh interesting who was Aaron's granddaughter and

Rosita
1:09:39
and and

Rosita
1:09:43
Yes, many marriages between cousins in this family.

Rosita
1:09:51
Veronica passed away. Very young, with cancer.

Rosita
1:09:59
And she had a relationship with the sister of Betty?

5
1:10:03
Or of Ruby?

Rosita
1:10:05
No, cousin of Ruby, daughter of Betty. Aaron tuvo tres hijas. La mayor se llamaba Sara. La del medio Sara, Zulema, Betty

Rosita
1:10:26
Ah ok, interesting So Betty, but Veronica? Daughter of Betty And Ruby was also daughter of Betty, right?

Rosita
1:10:41
and the...

Rosita
1:10:43
wait a minute no, let's see

Eric
1:10:47
wait a minute

Rosita
1:10:49
it looks like I made a salad let me think let me think a little let's see, the Ruby the Ruby, Mario the...

Rosita
1:11:01
no, it's not Nana it's another generation I'm thinking about Betty's children. Here I have what you told me last time, that Betty was married to Jacobo Link.

Rosita
1:11:24
Jacobo Link, yes. And the daughter was Ruby. And what did she have? Ruby and Link too.

Rosita
1:11:34
the Who?

12
1:11:49
Where?

Rosita
1:11:50
Let's see, have I ever told you about the Chita Casablanca?

11
1:11:53
Who?

Rosita
1:11:53
No, I don't think so. Chita?

Eric
1:11:54
Chita.

4
1:11:55
Who was she?

Rosita
1:11:56
Let's see. Wait, she's Veronica's mom, but I have a salad right now.

6
1:12:01
Let's see. Let me start.

Eric
1:12:02
Start.

Rosita
1:12:03
Let me start again.

Rosita
1:12:05
Zulema has, what I told you before, Jorge, Jackie Lynn, and Monica.

Rosita
1:12:15
Those are the children of Zulema. We are talking about Aaron's three daughters. After that, Betty had Mario And Chita, Chita is the daughter of Betty Her name is Isabel, they called her Chita

Eric
1:12:36
And Ruby?

Rosita
1:12:37
And Ruby?

5
1:12:38
She is the daughter of Betty

Rosita
1:12:39
And what relationship does Ruby have with Betty? Ruby too Ah, so ¿Qué relación tiene la Betty? La Ruby también. La Isabel.

Rosita
1:12:49
La Ruby.

Eric
1:12:51
Y hay otra más. Otra más casada con un médico radiólogo.

Rosita
1:12:55
Él es Conn. Y ella no me acuerdo cómo se llama en este mundo. Es la menor. O sea, son tres mujeres y un hombre.

5
1:13:03
¿Y el hombre fue el papá de la Verónica?

Rosita
1:13:05
El hombre no. y el hombre fue el papá de la verónica? el hombre no, el hombre se llama... Marco?

Rosita
1:13:15
parece que Marco, es arquitecto también

10
1:13:18
Marco Link

Rosita
1:13:19
así que la ruby tenía una hermana que se llamaba Isabel, Chita y tenía un hermano que se llamaba Marco tiene tiene un hermano que se llama Marco. Tiene. Tiene. Y otra hermana que no me acuerdo en este minuto.

Rosita
1:13:37
Y la chita, o Isabel, la Isabel estaba casada con un señor de apellido Pupkin.

Rosita
1:14:28
P-U-P-K-I-N.

Rosita
1:14:31
P-U-P-K-I-N. Pupkin.

Eric
1:14:35
Correcto.

Rosita
1:14:37
Y la Isabel, entonces, es la mamá de la Verónica, y es la mamá de una chica que se llama Janet.

6
1:14:50
and her name is Jeanette

Rosita
1:14:52
So Veronica was a Pupkin Veronica was a Pupkin She was the daughter of Isabel Link Of Isabel Link Cool, the salad is untangled there

Rosita
1:15:02
We untied the salad

Rosita
1:15:03
Let's see, untangled, I already clarified Yes, now I think I understand I'll explain it to you. I'll explain it to you.

Rosita
1:15:12
Yes, now I think I understand. I don't want salad anymore.

Rosita
1:15:16
No, you don't want salad anymore? I don't want it anymore. Interesting, and also, the other thing, I don't know if, I think I told you, but Aaron Haiplez comes out as a founding member of the Jewish community in Chile. Is that so? Yes, it appears in a document that has a list of all the people who signed there in 1909

Rosita
1:15:46
to establish an Israeli community in Santiago. And it has the date, the year? Yes, August 8, 1909. 1909. And there are a lot of names, Brodsky, Bubis, Cohen, Dorfman, Feges, Friedman, Friedlander, there is a whole document and there is Aaron Heitles also one thing that also mentioned me the ingrid

Rosita
1:16:21
you know that he came to Chile because he had a trachoma or something so he had arrived first to new york

Rosita
1:16:33
Yes, and...

Rosita
1:16:35
And it seems that he was only 18 years old, more or less

Eric
1:16:39
Incredible, he had traveled alone from Europe

Rosita
1:16:42
Yes, you know that in that time they tried to get them out of Russia before they took them to the army

Rosita
1:16:54
Because the military service lasted 25 years

Rosita
1:16:58
Oh wow, that's an investment So I can't complain much about my 5 year career in the doctorate No, not at all Jaime Motley was also very interested in the family's history.

Rosita
1:17:12
And when she asked him, he advised her to give up on the search for the Heikles, but to focus on the name Berdychewski. Does that ring a bell to you? I know there are many verdiches, but I don't know what their relationship is with their family. Not at all. I don't know. Me neither. The suggestion was very cryptic. If you ever talk to her, ask her.

Rosita
1:17:45
But I don't remember that name. Yes, and none of the people I named have married a Berditski.

Rosita
1:17:59
There are people I don't know who they married. For example, among the Fasle, the women, Jenny married a Kosidoe.

Rosita
1:18:11
Paulina married an Isexson.

Rosita
1:18:16
Marook-son Ah Paulina married an Isakson? Yes Ah yes, Isakson And he was a rich guy

Rosita
1:18:28
It's weird, Maria Judea, right? But it's weird. But well, in the case they called her Maruka. And I don't know who she married.

Eric
1:18:36
Maruka.

Rosita
1:18:36
I don't know what last name she had. Now, of these three women, the one in the middle, Paulina, was a beauty. Paulina was a beauty? She was very pretty. Very pretty.

Rosita
1:18:49
I don't remember if she had a good figure or not, but she had a very nice face.

Rosita
1:19:04
And her children, that little piece over there. I'll tell you about the little pieces another day. Ok, one last question before we let you rest a little. Aaron, do you remember? Who? Aaron Heikles Yes

Rosita
1:19:28
Apparently he was a man with a lot of influence in the Jewish community. Do you remember anything about his... No, nothing I don't know

Rosita
1:20:28
Yes, that should surely appear in some notes, or maybe the English knows more

9
1:20:33
I'll let you know if I learn something more about him

Rosita
1:20:35
Hello?

Eric
1:20:42
Hello? Hello?

Rosita
1:21:20
Can you hear me?

Rosita
1:21:22
Yes, I can hear you.

Rosita
1:21:24
Good, well... I can't tell you that. What I know is that his wife was Argentinian. Elisa is married there.

Eric
1:21:32
Do you know how he met an Argentinian?

Rosita
1:21:34
No. Maybe you had moved to Chile before. No, I met him when I arrived in Santiago

Rosita
1:21:48
and we went to live, well, there I met all the Santiago family and we also lived, as I told you, the first two or three years that I lived in Santiago, we lived a block from their house

Eric
1:22:02
oh wow well thank you thank you for what?

Rosita
1:22:03
thank you for letting me ask you so many questions

Eric
1:22:06
you're welcome

Rosita
1:22:07
you're welcome, it's been very entertaining for me well I'm going to do a little more research on this boat

Rosita
1:22:14
to see if I can find a little more about this family

Rosita
1:22:18
and when they left New York and when he arrived in Chile, but I send you a document with this new information to see if...

Rosita
1:22:37
Well, what I find out about the Graver, look, as I tell you, the Graver with whom we had more contact died, but the other, maybe your dad knows how to contact Fernando. Or maybe your mother knows something. Although the one I had the most contact with is the one who passed away.

Rosita
1:23:05
What was his name?

Rosita
1:23:06
He came to Chile. He came to Chile. I was at the house of Saint Paul. He left me a name.

Rosita
1:23:15
What was the name of the guy? Oh, one interesting thing I found, the only thing I found when I search for the last name Graber is a passport, or a visa of Nano. It seems that he entered Brazil in the year, like, 56, around there. Do you know why he returned to Brazil? Maybe to visit his cousins or to work there? 56? Yes, in the 50's I found a photo of Nano because he had applied for a Brazilian visa.

Rosita
1:23:51
No, I don't remember. I'm thinking of the 50's, Nano was 20 and he was 17.

Eric
1:24:04
17

Rosita
1:24:06
17

Rosita
1:24:08
I was finishing school

8
1:24:10
Let me see if I can find the...

Rosita
1:24:12
Let's see... I don't know, but Nano... Well, Nano He went to university What year did he go to university? I don't know

Rosita
1:24:24
He was very young

Eric
1:24:26
He must have gone in at 18 or 19

Rosita
1:24:27
I don't know, I was thinking about what to do when I finished school Maybe around that time

Rosita
1:24:33
It was the year 58, so... Ah, 58, no, 58

Rosita
1:24:39
I must have been pretty advanced in my studies Yes, you were 25 years old But you have to remember that date. Because... Let's see, I received... I received it in 1953,

Rosita
1:24:56
and he received it in 1958. Maybe when he just received it... Oh, it could be because... Look, maybe... Maybe he was interested in the possibility of doing a specialty in ophthalmology because they were doctors recently received from Chile

Rosita
1:25:22
to do a specialization in Brazil it could be for that

Rosita
1:25:26
Ah, interesting I'm looking at the photo now, in this cell and I really find it very similar to my dad

Eric
1:25:38
Your dad?

Rosita
1:25:40
Yes, I found a trace I'm going to send you this document, it's interesting

Eric
1:25:44
No, I never thought they would look alike

Rosita
1:25:46
The truth is that no It could be in this photo only

Rosita
1:25:50
No, I don't know, I have a big picture of the dwarf here, if I get the sea I will look at it carefully

Rosita
1:26:10
Well, I hope you stay healthy I hope so, I hope the same and that you have a good PESA Oh yeah, did you celebrate a little through Zoom?

Rosita
1:26:23
No, nothing. I didn't even buy matzo, which is what I'm most sorry for.

Rosita
1:26:29
I made haroset with my apartment mate. Oh yeah? We made haroset and I also boiled some eggs. But apart from that, we also ate matzo, but apart from that we didn't do much. I have some friends, I made some friends in Boston who are not more religious but they celebrate more the traditions So they invited me to make a seder through Zoom, through video

Rosita
1:26:58
Oh, look, here there are also some who are offering lunch through Zoom But as I was saying, it's not that easy to find the salamander cookie here. And since I couldn't go out, I just didn't buy it. So, anyway, I eat bread anyway, right? But I like the cookie, it's very good with palta.

Rosita
1:27:38
Oh yeah, with palta or a lot of people do it with chocolate.

Rosita
1:27:42
They sell some cookies with chocolate. Also, it's done. You can find that in the stores where they sell it.

Rosita
1:27:53
But if you could visit my parents in Monterrey, they have a beautiful house. But we'll see.

Rosita
1:28:15
Here in Chile, the LAN suspended all international flights Yes, it has become very difficult to travel and it is not a good idea to travel

Rosita
1:28:27
No, it's not a very good idea, so we'll see what time brings us, right? Yes, it may be that Rosalana stops

Rosita
1:28:36
It may be, but it was very entertaining to talk to you

Rosita
1:28:50
Yeah, same

Rosita
1:28:51

Rosita
1:28:52
