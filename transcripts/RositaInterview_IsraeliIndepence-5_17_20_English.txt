In Chile, do you remember if there were huge parties when the partition was declared?

Rosita
0:00:11
Or was it because the Jews in Chile at that time were estimated at 30,000, most of them in Santiago, many of them in good condition. I was 17 years old, I could remember more, but I don't remember. There were Jewish organizations at the time, like Asher Mera Tzair, Kibb, Beneficence, WISO, so I think that in each of those institutions there must have been celebrations. But I personally don't remember. What I do remember is that in those days, in the youth groups where I was, there were good speakers among the young people who informed us, who told us, who prepared us a little.

Rosita
0:01:47
But, let's say, a public thing, I don't know, with flags and horns and all that, I don't know.

Eric
0:01:57
Interesting. What was the debate? The debate was if it should be... The debate... What was the debate? Let's see, how come I can't hear you now? You said there was a lot of debate on the subject, but was it a debate more about how it should be divided or if it should be divided or something like that?

Rosita
0:02:16
The most prepared among the young people. And I imagine that for adults of that time, it has also been the same.

Eric
0:03:00
Yes, because it was much more difficult to get information than now.

Rosita
0:03:08
That was the wave.

Eric
0:03:09
Do you hear me?

Eric
0:03:10
Now I don't hear anything.

Rosita
0:03:12
And now neither? Now yes.

Eric
0:03:15
Ah, I was going to say that it was much more difficult, of course, to get information, so there was no other way.

Rosita
0:03:23
Of course, yes, well, what was there at that time, what is it called, the teletype? Ah, yes, the telegraph, I don't know

Eric
0:03:38
yes

Eric
0:03:40
how interesting

Rosita
0:03:42
the telephone was not so international, it was not so common and well so of course, the communications were not so expeditious no, nothing to do with now, nothing to do but as I tell you, everything was... How do you say?

Rosita
0:04:03
It was all well-matched, well-informed. We knew what was happening.

Eric
0:04:09
And I'm sure that some of you had relatives in Israel.

Eric
0:04:14
No, we didn't. We didn't, as far as I remember.

Rosita
0:04:18
The relatives that I know, they have left later. In that time, who was in Israel? The first settlers, those who left with the Jalusian movements, which were called to dry the swamps and work the land, and then the immigrants who arrived a little before the war and during the war, who were able to escape to Palestine.

Rosita
0:04:50
There weren't many people there. There were people like Golda Meir, right? Who was born, I think, in the United States and left. There were people, but the population was small. And that makes it even more impressive the fact that they were able to have all those wars with the Arabs

Eric
0:05:26
Yes, really incredible

Rosita
0:05:28
that the state declared itself. Now, during the British occupation, there was already an armed group. There was a group that we could call the terrorists, the GANAH. Ah, yes. The GANAH with a, I think the last name of the main one there was Stern. Yes, Stern, that was the one who put a bomb in that hotel. Yes, there was a lot of boycott against the English before the creation of the state.

Eric
0:06:20
Yes, that book, O Jerusalem, I read it. So they had, let's say, some army skeleton or something like that.

Rosita
0:06:29
Incredible. I've been reading a lot... But in two ways it's impressive.

Eric
0:06:34
I've been reading a lot about, well, while I've been doing these investigations and learning more about the family, Sometimes I get a little lost and I find some interesting articles. I've been reading about all the Jewish communities in the world. Of course, in Europe they were decimated, but in the rest of the world there were many Jewish communities, like in Yemen, in Uzbekistan, in all these Arab countries. In China, even China. And it's incredible that...

Eric
0:07:16
Well, in India there were many...

Rosita
0:07:18
In China, no. In India, in China, there is an area, a place that is called Harbin.

Eric
0:07:26
With an H.

Rosita
0:07:28
Look it up. What's it called? It's written H-A-Harbin. The first letter is an H.

Eric
0:07:36
Harbin. Did you go to China?

Rosita
0:07:40
No, but I saw it several times on some... on some... on television, some information. And from the... from the Jewish colony, let's say, from the Jewish colony there in this place, which is very... it seems very north of China, I don't know if it's near Mongolia or... or somewhere around there. And well, as you say, in India and Uzbekistan, well, in those places I had not had to read.

Eric
0:08:16
Yes, it seems that they are called, it seems that they are called Bukovina or something like that. And... How many? They are called Bukovina. Ah, Bukovina. But Bukovina was not a part of Russia?

Eric
0:08:34
Yes, but it seems that now it is in Uzbekistan. And I did not know, but it seems that... Bukovina is in Uzbekistan? I think so. It seems that there were like 100,000 or 200,000 Jews there, that in the last... I was reading an article that just came out in the New York Times where they talked about this community and that now half live in Israel and the other half live in New York. And it's amazing how there are no longer Jewish communities in

Eric
0:09:07
all these parts of the pogroms, I imagine that those who could leave, left. Yes, exactly.

Rosita
0:09:31
the state of Israel, what they lived in the Arab countries, for example, in Persia, Iran, that is, everyone had to go, they were treated extremely badly. Yes, immediately. And in Persia, to exclude from a series of things because you have this gene, for example. Yes, right, yes. But hey, no, that's what I mean when I say, when I talk about ethical problems.

Rosita
0:10:04
But...

Eric
0:10:05
A lot of people talk about how in athleticism, in the athleticism races, that for example, women with more testosterone are faster, so they are talking about how it is ethical to have different divisions for people with these levels of testosterone. So imagine if that conversation reaches the level of genes.

Eric
0:10:33
Of course, of course.

Rosita
0:10:35
Well, I mean, it's super complicated.

4
0:10:38
Yes.

Rosita
0:10:39
I mean, the technology is tremendously attractive, but...

Eric
0:10:50
But it's scary, all of a sudden, right?

Rosita
0:10:52
Yes, and one sees it especially with this virus.

Eric
0:10:54
I always... People are worried about climate change, how do you say, global warming. And I agree that it's a serious problem, but I think that what should worry us the most, more than that and more than nuclear war, is biological terrorism.

Eric
0:11:20
And one sees with this virus to not be susceptible to get sick. Yes, it's true. But people who commit suicide with bombs, it seems like they don't care about that.

Rosita
0:11:56
Yes, that's also true. Well, let's not talk about that terrible thing. Yes, that's also true. Well, let's not talk about that terrible thing.

Eric
0:12:03
We don't have that thing so terrible.
